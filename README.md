# AdoptAMonsterSite
This is a website that users can visit and setup a login which allows the user to "adopt" a horror movie monster. A user can select a monster on the website and allows them to view the data about the monster (e.g. History, Origin, First appearance, etc.) and gives them a option to adopt.

## Definitions
- "Adopt" means that the user takes care of a monster. That means that they can feed it, take it for a walk, or use it to scare other monsters.
