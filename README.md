# AdoptAMonsterSite

This website allows visitors to create user accounts, view monster listings, 
and with permissions granted by having a user account they can adopt their own monster. 
Depending on access level certain users will also be able to make listings 
and take down their own listings with an even higher tier of access to edit 
and delete other monster listings not made by the set user.

The monsters that the user will be able to adopt are based in the horror genre wether it be through books, movies, or games, just as a way to further connect with certain pop culture monsters.

There will also be various activities for the user to perform with their monster in the near future as the website takes shape.
