# AdoptAMonsterSite [(Try the online site here)](https://adoptamonster-alex-f2awgzayfcaxd7d8.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/)

This website allows visitors to create user accounts, create monsters, view monster listings, 
and adopt their own monster or two. 

The monsters that the user will be able to adopt are based in the horror genre whether it be through books, movies, or games, just as a way to further connect with certain pop culture monsters.

There will also be various activities for the user to perform with their monster in the near future as the website takes shape.
